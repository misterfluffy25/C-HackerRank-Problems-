Problem - 

/*A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
A sample loop is

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

Input Format

You will be given two positive integers,  and  (), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer  in the inclusive interval :

If , then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for , and so on.
Else if  and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if  and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
Note: 

Sample Input

8
11
Sample Output

eight
nine
even
odd*/

Solution - 

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Complete the code.
    int a,b;
    int n=0;
    string intMap[9]= {"one", "two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine"};
    
    cin>>a>>b;
    
    if ((a<=9)&&(b<=9)){ 
       for(n=a;n<=b;n++){
            cout << intMap[n-1]<<endl; 
        } }
    else if ((a<=9)&&(b>9)){    
        for(n=a;n<=9;n++){
            cout<<intMap[n-1]<<endl;
        }    
        for(n=10;n<=b;n++){    
            if (n%2==0){
                cout<<"even"<<endl;
            }
             else {
                 cout<<"odd"<<endl;
             }
         }
  }
    
    else {
        for(n=a;n<=b;n++){
            if (n%2==0){
                cout<<"even"<<endl;
            }
             else {
                 cout<<"odd"<<endl;
             }
        }
            
    }
    
    
    
    return 0;
}
